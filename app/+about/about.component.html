<h2>About this application</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
  I am currently learning how to develop modern web applications. Therefore, I finished the Front End Certification from
  <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">freeCodeCamp</a> and I'm currently working on the Back End Certification. One of
  the challenges comprises the development of a voting application. The following user stories should be implemented:
</p>

Authenticated users can
<ul>
  <li>keep my polls and come back later to access them.</li>
  <li>share my polls with my friends.</li>
  <li>see the aggregate results of my polls.</li>
  <li>delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.</li>
  <li>create a poll with any number of possible items.</li>
</ul>
All users, authenticated or not, can
<ul>
  <li>see and vote on everyone's polls.</li>
  <li>see the results of polls in chart form.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Technologies used</h3>
<p>
  The frameworks taught at freeCodeCamp include jQuery for the front end and node.js with express.js and mongoDB for the back
  end. As those frameworks have already been covered extensively, I decided to implement the application with different frameworks.
</p>

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt><a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a></dt>
  <dd>CSS framework for making the user interface responsive.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://angular.io">Angular2 (RC-1)</a></dt>
  <dd>Client-side JavaScript framework based on the MVC pattern to create single-page applications.</dd>

  <dt><a href="https://www.firebase.com">Firebase</a></dt>
  <dd>Backend as a service responsible for storing the data and user authentication.
    <a href="https://angularfire2.com">AngularFire2</a> is used as an integration layer between Angular 2 and Firebase.
  </dd>

<h3>Implementation notes</h3>

<p>The application is implemented based on the Angular 2 framework, currently in version RC-1. Unfortunately, despite the label
  "Release Candidate", the maturity of the framework lacks a bit behind. The main concepts such as component-based development
  and dependency injection are implemented in a very elegant manner, but there are still quite a few bugs or missing features,
  e.g., resetting the state of a form. Also, during the development of this project, the old router was deprecated and a
  new one is intoduced which has a large number of issues.</p>

<p>The use of Firebase was completely new to me. My prior experience with backend development was based on relational DBMS.
  Firebase is a NoSQL-DB where documents are stored in JSON format. The beauty of Firebase is that it doesn't require an
  own backend server (the backend is basically a service) and everyting is reactive. For instance, open a second browser
  window in incognito mode (or use one on a different device), go to a poll and then cast a vote within the first browser
  window. The results are reflected within minimal time in the second browser window without the need to refresh - the data
  gets pushed to the client automatically.
</p>


<h3>Limitations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>We are not storing information about which user voted on which poll. Hence, it is possible to cast several votes (for the
    same option or different ones).
  </li>
  <li>The application has issues when running in Safari on OSX.
    <ul>
      <li><code>Can't find variable: Intl</code>: This is a
        <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/3333">known bug</a> caused by Safari not supporting I18N. It will
        hopefully be fixed in the final version with a polyfill.</li>
      <li><code>the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)</code>: This is caused by
        <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/706">Angular CLI</a> currently not including the source maps
        to speed up development build times. It can be fixed easily by integrating the source map files into the build but
        is currently left out, as the CLI team might change this in the future.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Currently only oauth authentication via github is provided. This is a choice by design as the application is only a proof
    of concept and other forms of authentication (Facebook, Twitter, Username&Password, ...) work similar.
  </li>
  <li>Non-authenticated users can still route to a path (e.g., to create a new poll) by navigating directly to the respective
    URL. Security rules are in place that they cannot create any data modification, but we want to avoid that they can go
    to the respective forms in the first place. This functionality (method <code>canActivate()</code> is not yet implemented
    in the redesigned router yet.</li>
</ul>
